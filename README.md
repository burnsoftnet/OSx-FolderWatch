# FolderWatch
Folder Watch is a simple application that will allow you to see what files are changed
in the target directory.  The Folder Watch class was taken from Martin Hwasser
MHWDirectoryWatcher https://github.com/hwaxxer/MHWDirectoryWatcher

This application was created to help with monitoring the mobile cloud directory while
testing an app.  Since some of the mobile cloud folders are hidden in Finder, this
application allowed me to manually plug in the full path to the cloud container that
was pulled from a terminal session to see if the file my app was creating was being updated.
